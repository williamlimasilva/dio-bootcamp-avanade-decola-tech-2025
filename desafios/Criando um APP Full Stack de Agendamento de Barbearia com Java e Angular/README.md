# Barber Shop Appointment Scheduling App

This project is a full-stack application for managing barber shop appointments, built with Java and Angular. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing clients, schedules, and appointments.

## Overview

The application consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend:** An Angular-based user interface for managing clients and scheduling appointments.
- **Backend:** A Java-based RESTful API for managing data and handling business logic.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using Angular and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the backend API.

### Key Features

- Client management (add, edit, delete).
- Appointment scheduling.
- Calendar view for appointments.
- Responsive design.

### Technologies

- Angular (>=17)
- Node.js (>=18)
- npm (>=8) or Yarn (>=1.22)
- Angular CLI (>=17)

### Architecture

- **Component-Based:** The UI is built using reusable Angular components.
- **Services:** Services handle business logic, data fetching, and state management.
- **Modules:** Feature modules encapsulate related components, services, and routes.
- **API Client:** Dedicated services handle communication with the backend API.

## Backend

The backend is built using Java with Spring Boot and provides a RESTful API for managing clients and schedules.

### Key Features

- RESTful API for client and schedule management.
- Data persistence using PostgreSQL.
- Database migrations using Flyway.
- Exception handling.

### Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway
- MapStruct
- Lombok
- Docker
- Gradle

### Architecture

- **RESTful API:** Designed as a RESTful API using Spring Boot.
- **Layered Architecture:** Separates concerns into distinct layers (Controller, Service, Repository, Entity).

### API Endpoints

The application offers the following REST endpoints:

#### Schedule Endpoints

- `POST /schedules` - Create a new appointment schedule

  - Request body: Contains appointment details including start time, end time, and client ID
  - Response: Returns the created schedule with its assigned ID
  - Status codes:
    - 201 CREATED on success
    - 400 BAD REQUEST if validation fails
    - 409 CONFLICT if schedule already exists at that time

- `DELETE /schedules/{id}` - Delete an existing schedule

  - Path variable: Schedule ID
  - Response: No content
  - Status codes:
    - 204 NO CONTENT on success
    - 404 NOT FOUND if schedule doesn't exist

- `GET /schedules/{year}/{month}` - Get all schedules for a specific month
  - Path variables: Year and month to fetch schedules for
  - Response: Returns all appointments for the specified month
  - Status code: 200 OK
